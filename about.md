  <s>After I played enough,</s> I decide to make full use of resource and serve them as a platform for the following several functionalities:
</p>

* __1 - Mixture of Things__
  * Serve as a mixture platform for blogs, online portfolio, and personal announcements center.

<div class="maxim">
Mixture of <strong>everything</strong> and <s>anything</s>!
